/** @fileOverview Javascript implementation of streaming integrity using sha256.
 *
 * Proof of concept not meant for any practical use.
 * Not very memory efficient and may cause unacceptable blocking.
 *
 * This is an implementation of an algorithm using sha256 to ensure integrity while streaming
 * a large file (e.g. video) by not requiring a recipient to receive the entire file
 * until the integrity may be verified. The file can instead be sent and verified block-by-block
 * and therefore enables streaming of files while still ensuring their total integrity.
 *
 * This is not a very practical implementation since it requires the file to be read and hashed
 * entirely before it can be sent in blocks, causing high memory consumption and possibly blocking
 * the server for relatively long periods of time.
